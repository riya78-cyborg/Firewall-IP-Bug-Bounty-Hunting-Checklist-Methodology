# Firewall IP Bug Bounty Hunting Checklist & Methodology

Welcome to the definitive checklist and methodology repository for hunting and testing firewall IP addresses in bug bounty or penetration testing engagements. This resource is designed to guide security researchers through every phase—from reconnaissance and fingerprinting to exploitation and reporting—while emphasizing safe and authorized testing.

## Overview

Firewalls often act as the gatekeepers for enterprise and organizational networks, making them crucial targets for security testing. This checklist provides a thorough approach tailored to firewall IP addresses with practical commands, tools, and techniques that can be copy-pasted into your workflow.

This project covers:

- Passive and active reconnaissance of firewall IPs (WHOIS, DNS, Shodan, Censys)
- Firewall fingerprinting and detection (traceroute, WAF detection tools)
- Port scanning and enumeration strategies optimized for firewalls
- Service detection and SSL/TLS certificate analysis
- Comprehensive vulnerability scanning with CVE research and exploitation guidelines
- Special handling of `503 Service Unavailable` responses
- Firewall bypass methods, stealth scanning, and IDS evasion
- Post-exploitation reconnaissance and network mapping
- Best practices for documentation, reporting, and responsible disclosure
- Risk management and legal compliance reminders

## How to Use This Checklist

1. Replace placeholder IPs (`0.0.0.0` or `1.1.1.1`) with your authorized target IP.
2. Follow the checklist phases in order for a systematic assessment.
3. Utilize the recommended tools and sample commands.
4. Document everything clearly for reporting and remediation.
5. Always ensure proper authorization and operate within scope.
